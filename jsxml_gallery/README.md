XML-based JavaScript Image Gallery
==================================

This small little piece of JS is a client-side image gallery that reads the gallery information from an XML file. It uses the [jQuery JavaScript library][jquery] (not included).

Features
--------

At the moment the following is supported:

* Storing multiple galleries in one XML file
* Image names and descriptions
* Linked images
* Alt and caption support
* Customizable messages
* Reports any error encountered loading the gallery (in a nice message)

Example
-------

An example gallery (with both the XML data file and a HTML page to demonstrate how to use the gallery on a page) is included. Please refer to it for basic usage information.
